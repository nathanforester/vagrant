# Virtualisation and Environments

### An environment:
- development: In software deployment an environment or tier is a computer system in which a computer program or software component is deployed and executed
- test: Test Environment Management is a function in the software delivery process which aids the software testing cycle by providing a validated, stable and usable test environment to execute the test scenarios or replicate bugs
- production: In software deployment an environment or tier is a computer system in which a computer program or software component is deployed and executed. In simple cases, such as developing and immediately executing a program on the same machine, there may be a single environment, but in industrial use the development environment and production environment are separated; often with several stages in between

#### Virtual Environment:

This environment allows those involved in the software development cycle to work on virtual machines to test software. Platforms such as Vagrant and Virtual Box VM can be used for this purpose

- It provides faster development and test mechanisms by creating development and test environments rapidly

#### Advantages of Cloud:

- Cost Savings
- Security
- Flexibility
- Mobility
- Insight
- Increased Collaboration
- Quality Control
- Disaster Recovery
- Loss Prevention
- Automatic Software Updates
- Competitive Edge
- Sustainability

#### Problems of Development in VEs:

- VM sprawl
- Sensitive data within a VM
- Security of offline & dormant VMs
- Security of pre-configured (golden image) VM/active VMs
- Lack of visibility and control over virtual networks
- Resource exhaustion
- Hypervisor security
- Unauthorized access to hypervisor
- Account or service hijacking through the self-service portal
- Workloads of different trust levels located on the same server

#### Advantages of DevOps:
- Deliver Value to Customers
DevOps minimizes the time it takes to deliver value to customers. The cycle time from developer completion of a story/defect/task to production is dramatically reduced allowing for value to be realized as quickly as possible. 
- Reduce Time - Make incremental changes to apps on the fly. Test and deploy. More agile, more valuable in the market by responding to customer demands. Fast, safer to market.
- Being more agile saving cost, Save developer time. While it's a large upfront investment, we're lowering the negative impact of operations. We've accelerated the speed at which we go to market and our ability to scale. We view DevOps as a business enablement tool.
- Problem resolution: The greatest value of successful DevOps higher confidence in delivery, visibility, and traceability to whatâ€™s going on, so you can solve problems quicker. s
